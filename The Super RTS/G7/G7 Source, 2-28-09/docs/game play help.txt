1. Getting Resources:
Resources are harvested by units that are gatherers and brought back to the HQ. There is no delay before the resource is added to the general store of mass.

2. Resource Spawning:
Resources will respawn, however, they will only repawn if there are others resources of the type near them. Over-harvesting will wipe out resource supply.
