1. Getting Resources:
Resources are harvested by units that are gatherers and brought back to the HQ. There is no delay before the resource is added to the general store of mass.

2. Resource Spawning:
Resources will respawn, however, they will only repawn if there are others resources of the type near them. Over-harvesting will wipe out resource supply.

3. Shot Collision Calculation:
Shots are deemed to have collided with a target if the boundary of the shot intersects the boundary of a unit. In addition that unit must not be of the same owner as the unit that originally fired the shot.
