directions:

to run:

-in Game, make sure *** Unit[] u = new Unit[2]; *** has a length equal to the number of connecting clients (it's a global varaible)
-likewise, in Server make sure *** ServerHelper[] sh = new ServerHelper[2]; *** has a length equal to the number of connecting clients (it's a global varaible)

1. run GameServerStarter, type the port as 4444
2. run Game to connect the clients (must be run as many times as there are clients before the game actually starts at the same time on all of them; thus, run game twice if there are a total of 2 connecting clients)


to speed up/ make better:
-dont repeatedly send the same key press (holding down a character will, after a second, send many of that character)
-some commands are lost when the user action buffer in the server is cleared after every iteration of the main thread (main thread runs after the clients are connected); instead, preserve the unsent user actions
