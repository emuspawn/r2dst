Real Time Network (RTN)

overview:
this prject creates a fairly real time network with the aim of creating an infastructure to send commands
such as key presses or mouse clicks over the network to all connected clients

structure:

server: accepts connections and creates server helpers, each server helper is assigned an id
by the server upon its creation

server helper: receives information from the clients and immediately relays the information to
other server clients which in turn send it to their clients, each server helper is registered
to one client, each server helper has one synchronized write method to ensure that information
written to the output stream is in the correct order, when the server helper receives a packet
from its associated client it automatically attaches the client's id to the packet when it relays
it to the other connected clients

client: receives data from the server helper that it is associated with, formats it into
a data input stream and sends it through an interpreter method, also includes a synchronized
write method to write data to its corresponding server helper, the write method is synchonized
to ensured information is written in the correct order, if the client fails to connect to the
server upon its creation it does not start its receiver thread and the method isConnected will
return false

server starter: a convenience class, simply creates a small gui to start a server on a specified port
