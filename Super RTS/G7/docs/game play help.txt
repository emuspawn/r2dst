1. Getting Resources:
Resources are harvested by units that are gatherers and brought back to the refinery. There is a short delay before the resource is added to the general store of mass because the refinery must process it. Each refinery can process several items at once and the time to process those items is determined by the amount of mass each item is worth.

2. Resource Spawning:
Resources will respawn, however, they will only repawn if there are others resources of the type near them. Over-harvesting will wipe out resource supply.
