# Introduction #
The Super Game is an amazingly customizable RTS where the player can do anything, level up and kill monsters, rule a city, take over enemy kingdoms, go on a killing spree in town, and many more...

I'll just quote a long block of chat from the IRC in here:

[18:42] <kylehav> also, the super game (the recent/new/original one) is just an amazing 
online rts we're making where you can do anything 
[18:42] <kylehav> the server will be up constantly, so the game world will carry over 
from day to day, and a town will stay slaughtered for a while 
[18:43] <kylehav> a person could help rebuild the town and npcs would go there 
[18:44] <kylehav> then the town could slowly rebuild, first making a town hall/center,
then some houses for people then slowly shops and stuff 
[18:44] <kylehav> the rate of this would be debated though, we dont want to make it too 
easy to exterminate everyone in the world 
[18:45] <kylehav> so a person could become a king, then control a small town/city 
[18:45] <kylehav> they would manage everything of the city, from guards and security to
economics 
[18:46] <kylehav> so they could hire new npc guards with good stats, train current ones 
[18:46] <kylehav> buy better equipment for guards with money they have(personal or from kingdom) 
[18:46] <kylehav> maybe enlist people from a mages guild to help 
[18:46] <kylehav> then on top of this there would be large areas of wilderness 
[18:47] <kylehav> monsters to go kill, dungeons to explore for awesome items 
[18:47] <kylehav> maybe key points in the world like altars or temples for kingdoms to fight over
